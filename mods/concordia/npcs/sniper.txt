him=Every time I see the prison, and think of the stain it is on our landscape...  It must be a nightmare for those inside.
him=I've never been inside, thank goodness.  The skeletons have never been able to conquer us, but I fear it won't stay that way, unless we fight back.
him=If you ever need help navigating the woods, talk to a Clan Ario sniper.  We've grown up in these mountains, and know them like the backs of our hands.

you=I've been told that Clan Ario knows the way to the Subterran city.
him=Aye, we do.  We've watched the entrance to their caves for more than a century - we used to mortal enemies.
him=These days, though, it's us against all the undead.  You'll have a challenge ahead of you trying to coax them into an alliance with us.
him=Head to the fields south of Justice, and walk to the center of the seeded field.  That's where you'll find the entrance to the underground caverns.  Good luck!

him=You've come a long way since you broke out of the labor camp with Justice.  The time has finally come to go back and free the others, though.  Orc as well as Human.
him=To the west of our camp is a cavern, with an underground city.  The skeletons have started trying to invade their tunnels, and the subterranean residents have finally realized they can't remain neutral.
him=You've been in the labor prison most recently, and know the most about the layout.  I need you to meet the Subterrans, forge an alliance with them, and formulate a plan.

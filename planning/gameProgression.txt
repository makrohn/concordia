8-bit - 8 dungeons.  
16-bit 10 towns, 10 dungeons.

6 tiers for most tiered things - armor levels, weapon levels

Boss every dungeon
Strong linearity

Look for a world map tileset.  Should be easily doable with collision layer and teleports.
Progress will be managed with a combination of chokepoints (eg gates) and difficulty (super huge monsters)

World Map won't have enemies

Dungeons - should have multiple rooms per map, since enemies regenerate.  A couple of chests.  Hopefully several maps per dungeon.
Try to get at least one mainline quest and one or two side quests per dungeon, and steps within to reward XP appropriately to hit target levels.
Towns - Should be small an easily navigable, with clearly marked signs.  Players should perhaps feel like they're seeing a sector of some towns if necessary.  I've already violated this with the labor camp.  Redesign labor camp to have a MUCH smaller area, with fields outside.  Make it long if necessary.  Too much wasted space.

Tree design - actives and passives for sword
elemental choices for magic
debuffs for the archer

Enemies need ranged and close powers

Best weapons require max in two stats
Best armors require max in one stat and half in the others

Come up with a currency name

Swings are all AoE
Shoots are all damage at range
Casts are short range damage but have effects

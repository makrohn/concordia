## Change 2/21/2013

Concordia now installs the Flare executables using the source code from https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine.  If you're upgrading from a prior version of Concordia, be aware that your settings will now be located in ~/.config/flare/settings.txt (or similar) and saves in ~/.local/share/saves/conc01_save*.txt (or similar).  If you have any trouble running Concordia, make sure that "concordia" is your only active mod.

## Valley of Concordia

Valley of Concordia is a a role-playing game based off of the Flare engine.  The goal is to produce an 8-bit length game within the adventure RPG genre.  Over the course of development, I hope to push the ability of FLARE to develop a storyline, even within a simple narrative structure.  I also hope it's fun!

## Installation

See the Flare-Engine repo for instructions on how to install Flare:

https://github.com/clintbellanger/flare-engine

Valley of Concordia is installed as a set of mods for Flare Engine. Place the contents of the "mods" folder inside Flare Engine's mods folder.

* On Windows, the mods folder will be in the same directory as the flare executable.
* On OSX, this will be inside the Flare.app folder, in Resources/mods 
* On Linux, the default location of the mods folder is /usr/local/share/flare/mods/

Then enable these mods in Flare's Configuration screen.

## Packaging and Distributing

If you are packaging Valley of Concordia for release (e.g. on an operating system's software repo), we suggest creating two packages.

* flare-engine the package that contains the single engine reused by several games
* concordia, a package that requires flare-engine that only contains this game data

When distributing flare-game you may elect to omit these folders which are not used at runtime.

* art_src contains the raw files (e.g. Blender files) used to generate Flare's art.
* tiled contains the Tiled-native map files used to export Flare's maps
* planning contains public spoilers about where game development is headed
* tools contains some scripts that other developers may find convenient to copy or modify

Savefile Change!
================

On 2/21/2013, the savefile mechanic was changed.  If you want to use your old savefiles from before the change, copy them from your Concordia save directory to your Flare save directory, and rename them from save#.txt to conc01_save#.txt
